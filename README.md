![The fleet in Elio](docs/screenshots/fleet.png)

Elio watches a fleet of Debian and Ubuntu servers from one place: which ones are healthy, what runs on them, which packages are vulnerable and how to fix them, who has an SSH key on them. Nothing to install on the servers: Elio logs in with its own SSH key and runs a short list of **read-only commands**, all written in one file you can review — [`config/ssh_commands.yml`](config/ssh_commands.yml).

> **Beta.** Elio is young (`v0.1.0-beta.2`). It is used on real servers, but expect rough edges, and read the [known limits](#known-limits).

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| **Health** | Load, memory, swap, disks and inodes, reboot required, failed services, clock sync, pending updates — with thresholds you set and 30 days of history. |
| **Inventory** | System and end-of-support date, network addresses (WireGuard included), packages (dpkg, snap), systemd services, **Docker** (containers, images, Compose projects), **scheduled tasks** (cron, systemd timers), listening ports and firewall (ufw, nftables, iptables), with suggested ufw rules to copy. |
| **Vulnerabilities** | CVEs of every package, from the Debian Security Tracker and Ubuntu's OSV data, matched with the inventory — no extra command on the servers. Grouped **by package with the update to make** (`apt-get install --only-upgrade linux-image-amd64`, then reboot). Scores from NVD, Red Hat and CVE.org (or your own providers), exploitation from EPSS and CISA KEV. |
| **Docker** | Unhealthy and restarting containers, images per server, **new versions published on the registries** (Docker Hub, GHCR, Quay, private ones), vulnerabilities of the images (Trivy or Grype if installed, else Elio's own matching). |
| **SSH keys** | A shared keyring (people and machines), keys added to or removed from a server in one click, **temporary access** that expires on its own, unknown keys flagged, rotation of Elio's own key without downtime. |
| **Alerts** | What needs attention, by severity, on the overview; activity log; notifications to Slack, Discord, email or a signed webhook; daily digest. |
| **Automation** | Every collection runs on schedule, on the whole fleet or per group, followed live in the *Tasks* page. |
| **Extensions** | **Uptime Kuma** (monitors attached to each server) and **OVHcloud** (IPs, network firewall, DNS records, services), read-only. |
| **Team** | Roles (admin, operator, read-only), invitations, mandatory two-factor authentication, ⌘K search everywhere, light and dark themes. |

The interface is in French for now.

## Quick start

With Docker:

```sh
mkdir elio && cd elio
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elio-fleet/elio/main/docker-compose.yml
docker run --rm ghcr.io/elio-fleet/elio:beta bin/elio-keys > .env    # the secrets of your installation
echo "ELIO_DATABASE_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 24)" >> .env
docker compose up -d
```

Open <http://localhost:8080> and create the first account: it is the administrator. Then, in *Paramètres → Général*, generate Elio's SSH key, add it to a server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, and add the server.

**Keep `.env` safe**: without its keys, the encrypted data (Elio's SSH key, API keys, webhooks) cannot be read back.

## Installing for real

Elio is a Rails application with PostgreSQL. Put it behind a reverse proxy with HTTPS (Caddy, Traefik, nginx).

- **Docker Compose**: the [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) above. Behind your HTTPS proxy, set `ELIO_HOST` (your domain) and remove `ELIO_FORCE_SSL: "false"`.
- **Kamal**: [`config/deploy.yml`](config/deploy.yml) is ready (HTTPS with Let's Encrypt); put the secrets in `.kamal/secrets` and run `bin/kamal setup`.
- **Updates**: pull the new image (`docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`); migrations run on start.
- **Backups**: the PostgreSQL databases and the `storage` volume (known host keys of the servers).

### Configuration

| Variable | |
|---|---|
| `SECRET_KEY_BASE`, `ACTIVE_RECORD_ENCRYPTION_PRIMARY_KEY`, `ACTIVE_RECORD_ENCRYPTION_DETERMINISTIC_KEY`, `ACTIVE_RECORD_ENCRYPTION_KEY_DERIVATION_SALT` | Secrets of the installation, printed by `bin/elio-keys`. **Required.** (An installation that keeps them in Rails credentials sets `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` instead.) |
| `ELIO_DATABASE_PASSWORD`, `PGHOST` | PostgreSQL password of the `elio` user, and host. Elio uses four databases: `elio_production`, `_cache`, `_queue`, `_cable`. |
| `ELIO_HOST` | Elio's domain: links in emails, and the only host name it answers to. |
| `ELIO_SETUP_TOKEN` | If set, asked when creating the first account (useful when Elio is reachable before you set it up). |
| `ELIO_FORCE_SSL` | `false` only to try Elio over plain HTTP. HTTPS is forced otherwise. |
| `SMTP_ADDRESS`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USERNAME`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `SMTP_AUTHENTICATION`, `ELIO_MAIL_FROM` | Emails: invitations, password reset, notifications. Without `SMTP_ADDRESS`, invitation links are to be copied. |
| `ELIO_PARALLEL_LIMIT` | Servers collected at the same time (4). |
| `ELIO_ACTIVITY_RETENTION_DAYS` | How long the activity log is kept (365, `0` = forever). |
| `ELIO_DEBIAN_TRACKER_URL`, `ELIO_UBUNTU_OSV_URL`, `ELIO_NVD_FEED_URL`, `ELIO_EPSS_URL`, `ELIO_KEV_URL` | Mirrors of the vulnerability feeds, for a closed network (they can also be imported by hand). |

Everything else — thresholds, notifications, automations, score providers, Docker registries, [extensions](#extensions) — is set in the interface, by an administrator. Secrets entered there (API keys, tokens, webhooks) are encrypted in the database.

### Preparing the servers

1. In *Paramètres → Général*, generate Elio's SSH key (Ed25519, kept encrypted).
2. Add its public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` of the account Elio will use (the page gives the command).
3. Add the server (or import many from a CSV or your `~/.ssh/config`), then run an inventory.

Elio reads everything an unprivileged account can read. Some details need root — the process behind each port, the firewall, Docker, the users' crontabs: log in as root, or give the account password-less `sudo`. Without it, those collections are marked *partial*.

Supported: **Debian and Ubuntu** (others get health and system only), Docker, snap.

## What Elio runs on your servers

**Every command is in [`config/ssh_commands.yml`](config/ssh_commands.yml)**, sorted by role then by distribution. It is the only place they are written: the application reads them from there, and a test fails if a command is sent from anywhere else. Values are always shell-escaped.

| For | Commands (read-only) |
|---|---|
| System, network | `/etc/os-release`, `uname`, `hostname`, `systemd-detect-virt`, `/proc`, `timedatectl`, `ip -j addr`, `ip -j link` |
| Health | `/proc/loadavg`, `/proc/meminfo`, `df`, `/var/run/reboot-required`, `systemctl --failed`, `apt-get -s dist-upgrade` (simulation) |
| Packages | `dpkg-query -W`, `apt list --upgradable`, `snap list` |
| Services, scheduled tasks | `systemctl list-units`, `list-unit-files`, `show` of the timers, `/etc/crontab`, `/etc/cron.d`, `/var/spool/cron` |
| Docker | `docker inspect` (state, health, restarts — **never the environment variables**), `docker stats`, `docker image inspect`, `docker system df`, `trivy` / `grype` if installed, `docker cp` of `os-release` and the dpkg status |
| Ports | `ss -tulpn`, `/proc/<pid>/cgroup`, `ufw status verbose`, `nft list ruleset`, `iptables -S INPUT` |
| SSH keys | reading `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`; **writing only** when you add or remove a key |

Elio **never changes the firewall** nor installs anything: suggested ufw rules and update commands are for you to review and run.

## Extensions

Elio can read what your other tools know and show it next to each server. Enable them in *Paramètres → Extensions* (administrators). They **only read**: Elio never creates, changes or deletes anything on these services, and a disabled extension leaves no trace in the interface. Every alert they raise is optional, with its own threshold.

### Uptime Kuma

- **Setup**: the address of your instance and an API key (*Uptime Kuma → Settings → API Keys*). *Tester la connexion* checks them before saving.
- Elio reads the `/metrics` page every 15 minutes (Uptime Kuma 1.x and 2.x) and **attaches each monitor to its server**: by the IP it watches (WireGuard addresses included), by host name (with DNS resolution as an option), or by the server's name in the monitor's name (`[SRV] web-prod-1`). An attachment can be corrected by hand and is kept.
- A **Monitors** tab on each server (state, response time, uptime over 24 hours and 30 days, certificate) and a **Monitors** page: monitors attached to no server, servers without any monitor.
- Optional alerts: server without a monitor (with groups to ignore), monitor down or back, certificate about to expire, uptime under a threshold, monitor in maintenance for too long.

### OVHcloud

- **Setup**: the API endpoint (EU, CA, US), an Application Key, an Application Secret and a Consumer Key **limited to GET requests**. *Droits à donner à la clé API* lists the exact rights for the products you check and opens OVH's token page already filled in. *Tester la connexion* reports missing rights, and **warns if the key could write** — make a new one then.
- Each product is a checkbox: IPs and reverse DNS, network firewall, anti-DDoS, DNS zones (all or some), dedicated servers, VPS, Public Cloud instances (all projects or some).
- An **OVH** tab on each server: the OVH service (offer, datacenter, expiration), its IPs and reverse, the network firewall rules and **whether they let each public port through**, anti-DDoS, the DNS records pointing to it. An **OVHcloud** page: services, IPs, DNS records, resources attached to no server.
- Optional alerts: service about to expire (automatic renewal taken into account), network firewall disabled, reverse DNS that does not match, server without a DNS record, DNS record pointing outside the fleet, OVH service not followed by Elio.

The OVH client of Elio only knows the GET method: it cannot write, whatever the key allows.

## Security

- Elio's SSH key, API keys, webhooks and 2FA secrets are **encrypted in the database** and never sent back to the browser.
- Two-factor authentication (TOTP and backup codes), mandatory by default for administrators and operators; roles; invitations only (no public sign-up); rate-limited sign-in and lockout; strict Content Security Policy.
- Servers' host keys are pinned on first connection; a change blocks the connection until an administrator accepts it.
- **Outbound connections** of Elio: the vulnerability feeds and score providers (Debian, OSV, NVD, Red Hat, CVE.org, FIRST, CISA — only the releases and CVEs of your fleet), the Docker registries (manifest `HEAD` requests), and the extensions you enable (your Uptime Kuma instance, the OVH API — read-only, see [Extensions](#extensions)). Nothing else, no telemetry. In a closed network, the feeds can be imported by hand.
- Found a vulnerability? Please report it privately: see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Known limits

- Full inventory for **Debian and Ubuntu** only. Ubuntu has not been tried on a real server yet.
- The Uptime Kuma and OVHcloud extensions were built on recorded API answers, not tried on a real account yet.
- Container image CVEs without Trivy or Grype: Debian and Ubuntu based images only (not Alpine).
- Debian rates few of its CVEs: the scores come from the providers you enable (NVD, Red Hat, CVE.org by default).
- The interface is in French.
