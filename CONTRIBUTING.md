# Contributing to Elio

Thanks for your interest! Issues, ideas and pull requests are welcome.

## Before you start

- **Bugs and ideas**: open an [issue](https://github.com/elio-fleet/elio/issues/new/choose). For a larger change, discuss it in an issue first.
- **Security issues**: never in a public issue, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- The interface is in **French**; code, comments, commit messages and tests are in **English**.

## Running Elio locally

Requirements: Ruby (version in [`.ruby-version`](.ruby-version)), PostgreSQL, Chrome for the system tests.

```sh
bin/setup          # gems, database, then starts the app (bin/dev) on http://localhost:3000
```

The first visit creates the first (administrator) account. Background jobs (Solid Queue) run inside the web server in development.

To try Elio on real machines, add a server whose `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` holds Elio's public key (Settings → General). Disposable virtual machines or containers with `sshd` are ideal.

## Tests

Every change comes with its tests (Minitest): models, controllers (integration), services, jobs, and system tests for the interface.

```sh
bin/rails test            # unit and integration tests
bin/rails test:system     # browser tests (Chrome)
bin/ci                    # everything the CI runs: style, security audits, tests
```

Rules that keep Elio safe and readable:

- **Every command sent to a server is in [`config/ssh_commands.yml`](config/ssh_commands.yml)**, read-only unless it is one of the `keys.*` commands. Values are inserted with `@{name}` and always shell-escaped. A test fails if a command is sent from elsewhere.
- Parsers of command outputs are tested on **real outputs** recorded in `test/fixtures/files/`, anonymized (no real hostname, IP, customer name).
- No network access in the tests: external services (registries, vulnerability feeds, extensions) are stubbed or served by a local test server.
- Secrets are encrypted in the database (Active Record Encryption) and never sent back to the browser.

## Code layout

Models, controllers and jobs are grouped by domain (`app/models/fleet`, `access`, `security`, `operations`…; the folders are not namespaces). Inventory collectors live in `app/services/inventory/collectors`, one per category, with a pure Ruby parser.

## Writing an extension

Extensions (Uptime Kuma, OVHcloud) bring what another tool knows next to each server. A new one:

- a class that inherits `Integrations::Base` in `app/services/integrations/`, registered in `Integration::REGISTRY`, with its `fields` (form of the settings, secrets encrypted), `test_connection`, `sync`, and the hooks it needs: `server_tabs` (partial `integrations/<key>/server_tab`), `sidebar_links`, `health_reasons`, `help_partial`;
- an automation (`Automation::KINDS`, with `integration:`) for its synchronization;
- **read-only**: requests go through `Integrations::Http`, which only knows `GET`; ask the user for a key with the fewest rights, and say so in the help;
- every alert optional (a setting each), activities declared in `Activity::KINDS` with their summary;
- tests on recorded and anonymized API answers (see `test/support/uptime_kuma_helpers.rb`, `ovh_helpers.rb`): no network in the tests.

## Pull requests

- One topic per pull request, with its tests; `bin/ci` green.
- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`feat(inventory): …`, `fix: …`), with a body that explains *why*.
- Add a line to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) under *Unreleased*.
